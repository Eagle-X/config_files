- dynamic dns: ddclient
    - if not in repo:
    - find on github / sourceforge
        - sourceforge.net/projects/ddclient
        - github.com/ddclient/ddclient

    (some tips, but check current docs, linuxquestions.org)
        - mkdir /etc/ddclient
        - mkdir /var/cache/ddclient
        - cp the samples to correct locs
        -had to enable 2 extra repos: epel-release and something else....
            -there are some perl packages that are not in the main repos


- to add a new virtualhost:
    - (make sure dns is pointing to correct IP)
    - add a log directory at /var/log/httpd/{site_name}
    - cp and modify an existing site dir in /var/www/html/
    - modify /etc/httpd/conf.d/vhost.conf
    - (generate certs for these sites...)

- to allow msmtp / sending mail, need to enable a security linux bool
    - getsebool -a
    - setsebool -P httpd_can_sendmail 1
        - P switch makes the rule permament
