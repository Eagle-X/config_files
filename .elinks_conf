## ELinks 0.12pre6 configuration file

## This is ELinks configuration file. You can edit it manually,
## if you wish so; this file is edited by ELinks when you save
## options through UI, however only option values will be altered
## and missing options will be added at the end of file; if option
## is not written in this file, but in some file included from it,
## it is NOT counted as missing. Note that all your formatting,
## own comments and so on will be kept as-is.
##
## Obviously, if you don't like what ELinks is going to do with
## this file, you can change it by altering the config.saving_style
## option. Come on, aren't we friendly guys after all?

# Automatically saved options
#

## config 
#  Configuration handling options.

  ## config.saving_style_w [0|1]
  #  This is internal option used when displaying a warning about obsolete
  #  config.saving_style. You shouldn't touch it.
  set config.saving_style_w = 1


## cookies 
#  Cookies options.

  ## cookies.accept_policy <num>
  #  Cookies accepting policy:
  #  0 is accept no cookies
  #  1 is ask for confirmation before accepting cookie
  #  2 is accept all cookies
  set cookies.accept_policy = 0

  ## cookies.max_age <num>
  #  Cookie maximum age (in days):
  #  -1 is use cookie's expiration date if any
  #  0  is force expiration at the end of session, ignoring
  #     cookie's expiration date
  #  1+ is use cookie's expiration date, but limit age to the
  #     given number of days
  set cookies.max_age = 0

  ## cookies.paranoid_security [0|1]
  #  When enabled, we'll require three dots in cookies domain for all
  #  non-international domains (instead of just two dots). Some countries have
  #  generic second level domains (eg. .com.pl, .co.uk) and allowing sites to
  #  set cookies for these generic domains could potentially be very bad. Note,
  #  it is off by default as it breaks a lot of sites.
  set cookies.paranoid_security = 1

  ## cookies.save [0|1]
  #  Whether cookies should be loaded from and saved to disk.
  set cookies.save = 0

  ## cookies.resave [0|1]

  #  saving (cookies.save) is off.

## document 
#  Document options.

  ## document.colors 
  #  Default document color settings.

    ## document.colors.use_document_colors <num>
    #  Use colors specified in document:
    #  0 is use always the default settings
    #  1 is use document colors if available, except background
    #  2 is use document colors, including background. This can
    #    mostly look very impressive, but some sites will appear
    #    really ugly. Note, that obviously if the background is
    #    not black, it will break the behaviour of transparency.
    set document.colors.use_document_colors = 2



## protocol 
#  Protocol specific options.

  ## protocol.rewrite 
  #  Rules for rewriting URIs entered in the goto dialog. It makes it possible
  #  to define a set of prefixes that will be expanded if they match a string
  #  entered in the goto dialog. The prefixes can be dumb, meaning that they
  #  work only like URI abbreviations, or smart ones, making it possible to pass
  #  arguments to them like search engine keywords.

    ## protocol.rewrite.smart 
    #  Smart prefixes, see enable-smart description for details.

      ## protocol.rewrite.smart.d <str>
      #  Replacement URI for this smartprefix:
      #  %c in the string means the current URL
      #  %s in the string means the whole argument to smartprefix
      #  %0,%1,...,%9 means argument 0, 1, ..., 9
      #  %% in the string means '%'
